Add elegant footnotes that expand directly in the content. Lightweight and print-friendly.

## Description ##

Isn't it annoying to jump back and forth when clicking on footnotes? Inline Notes is taking a more intuitive approach by showing footnotes directly in the paragraph.

Just click on a footnote and the associated text gets displayed right after it, without distracting you. When printing out the content or reading it through the RSS feed, notes will be appended to the content the old-school way.

You see, the plugin just works. There's no options page, just beautiful inline notes.

**Shortcode usage:** `lorem ipsum... [note text="World's leading content management system"]WordPress[/note] ...text goes on`  

## Installation ##

1. Upload the `inline-notes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
**1. Use some shortcodes in your blog posts! Example Shortcode usage:** `[note text="WordPress Conferences"]WordCamps[/note]`
